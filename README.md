# Airline_Passenger_ML
A Kaggle project to train and test an ML model. 

The aim of this project is to demonstrate solid introductory skills and understanding to predictive analytics. 

The repo consists of two notebooks that document my workflow. One is dedicated to data exploration with an emphasis on data visualization. The other notebook is where I fit and tested two ML models to compare their performances. Both notebooks are dicussed on my portfolio website in a manner approachable to non technical audiences. https://riainfitzsimons.notion.site/?pvs=74
